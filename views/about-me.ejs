					<h4 class="display-4">My Bio</h4>
					<p class="mt-3"><span class="tab"></span>I am currently a sophomore in the College of Engineering at Texas A&M University pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Throughout the last two years, I have developed my technical skillset by building several small projects. Most recently, I built Raymind.me, a website where users can create lists and fill them with ‘todo’ style tasks. This allows an easy way to ‘Raymind’ yourself about upcoming projects, due dates, or calculus homework. This project allowed me to further my knowledge of backend development by getting my feet wet with unfamiliar technologies like Node.js and MongoDB.</p>

					<p><span class="tab"></span>Outside of developing software development, I recently had the pleasure of beginning work as Resident Advisor at Hart Hall at Texas A&M. Within this position, I am responsible for building community within my ramp and assisting my residents with their academics, personal life, and in some cases professional life. This position has allowed me to develop several skills including the ability to work on a team, to communicate effectively, and the ability to organize and plan events.</p>

					<p><span class="tab"></span>In my free time I enjoy learning, reading, working on personal projects, as well as spending time with friends and exploring A&M’s beautiful campus.</p>

						Maintain a passion for learning.
						Read a book a month.
